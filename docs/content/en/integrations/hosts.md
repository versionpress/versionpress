# Hosts

As described on the [installation page](../getting-started/installation-uninstallation.md), VersionPress has stricter system requirements than vanilla WordPress – specifically, we require Git on the server and `proc_open()` enabled. This is for [good reasons](../feature-focus/git.md) but also means that hosting is a bit of a challenge. Most of our early users run VersionPress on dedicated servers or VPS's that allow complete control and that's still recommended, however, there are also a couple of shared hosts that fully support VersionPress today.

!!! important
    The info here largely applies to the single-site features of VersionPress only. Version 2.0 added support for [sync / team workflows](../sync/index.md) that are even more tricky to support on a shared hosting. For those scenarios, VPS or a custom server is strongly recommended.

## Unsupported hosts

Here are some unsupported hosts for the moment. If you are their customer, please let them know that you'd be interested in VersionPress support – if they see more demand for it they might add support for it.

- [ ] **WP Engine** – they have intentionally restricted environment that doesn't allow `proc_open()`. We acknowledge that WPE is important to our users and are actively looking into how to support it.
- [ ] **DreamHost**
- [ ] **FlyWheel** – they don't have Git installed
