## New in 4.0-alpha1

### Plugin support

!!! note ""
    👋 We're looking for feedback on this, please chat with us [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/versionpress/versionpress).

Plugins can now be described to VersionPress using a set of plugin definitions in a `.versionpress` folder. These include:

- `actions.yml` defining plugin actions
- `schema.yml` describing how the plugin stores data in the database
- `shortcodes.yml` defining any new shortcodes the plugin introduces
- `hooks.php` containing any filters and actions further customizing the functionality

See [plugin-support.md](../developer/plugin-support.md) for more details. Issue: [#1036](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/1036) ([PR #1075](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/pull/1075)).
