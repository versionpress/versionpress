# System Info Page

As VersionPress is [more demanding](../getting-started/installation-uninstallation) on server environment than your common WordPress installation, we've created a system info page that gives more insight into what is actually available on the server.

The system info page is available at this URL:

``` bash
http://YOURSITE/wp-admin/admin.php?page=versionpress%2Fadmin%2Fsystem-info.php
```

You can also find a link to this page from the bottom left corner of the initialization page:

<figure style="width: 80%;">
  <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26038405/04a0dc9a-3908-11e7-93c8-c5f92e5d66ea.png" alt="Link to system info page" />
  <figcaption>Link to system info page from the initialization screen</figcaption>
</figure>

After the initialization, the only way to access the system info page is to use the URL above. (You shouldn't need it often.)
