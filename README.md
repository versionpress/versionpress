# VersionPress

Combining the best of both worlds, VersionPress is a user-friendly versioning solution for WordPress powered by Git. You can:

- See history of your site
- Undo anything, incl. database changes
- Roll back to previous states
- Create safe staging environments: `wp vp clone --name=staging`
- Merge databases: `wp vp pull --from=staging`
- Push to GitHub or implement any workflow you like
